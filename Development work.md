</p/>Attributes: name, xpos, zpos, services, phone number
</p/>Methods: __str__(), save()
	</p/>-object for each type of service, services class should be able to be create technically unlimited objects

    </p/>-june 3

2. Create a class for user info
</p/>Attributes: name, xpos, zpos, needs, phone number
</p/>Methods: distance from user(), save(), __str__(), get_services()
	</p/>-temporary object for each user
	</p/>-june 3-5

3. Create a method/function that sorts services based on criteria
	</p/>-may 31</p/>-june 3

	</p/>-june 5-6
5. Clean up interface to make usable and clear
	</p/>-june 6-7
6. additional alpha testing and bugfixes
